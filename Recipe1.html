        <h3>Ingredients for the cake:</h3>

            <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red food color (may add more depending on color preference)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon distilled vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (can add two to increase vanilla flavor)</li>
            <li>1 ½ cup of sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <div class=button_add>
            <h3>Add Ingredient</h3>
            <label for="newIngredient">Ingredient: </label>"
            <input id="newIngredient" placeholder="(add your ingredients)">
            <button class="button_add_ingredients" onclick="add_ingredients()"> Add Ingredient</button>
        </div>
        <pre>
            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        *Note: Can use either two 8-inch cake pans or two 9-inch cake pans depending on how tall you want your cake to be. The picture shows 3-layer cake using three 9-inch cake pans (I increased the quantities of the ingredients by ½ to make the 3-layers). If you are using 8-inch pans, bake for about 30 minutes or until tester inserted into the center comes out clean.
        For cake:
            Preheat oven to 350˚F. Butter and flour two 8-inch pans with 1 ½ inch high sides. Sift flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into medium bowl. Whisk buttermilk, food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla in small bowl to blend. Using electric mixture and a paddle to beat the sugar and butter into a large bowl until well blended. Add 1 egg at a time, beating until well blended after each addition. Beat in dry ingredients in 4 additions alternately with buttermilk mixture in 3 additions. 
        Divide batter between prepared pans (tip: use scale to even out batter in each pan)
        Bake cakes until tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 27 minutes. Cool pans on racks for 10 minutes. Turn cakes out onto racks and cool completely.
